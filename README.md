Kiosk Checkout System (KCS) is a simple web application for checking items in and out. We were having to juggle about four clipboards at the office in order to check out vehicles and laptops and equipment when going onsite. This method was frustrating to us engineers and also to our coordinator who had to track these things. We never knew if a vehicle had gas in it or not until we were sitting in it, ready to go. It was also difficult to know who had a particular item that was in demand and needed for a project.

Hence, I developed KCS. Originally it was just to meet the need at work. But then I saw how useful it was to us and aleviated so much frustration, so I decided to license it for propietary use and convert it to a cloud application. I got pretty far with that project but found connecting KCSSites it to a payment gateway was more challenging than I thought. Eventually, after weeks and weeks of deliberating and trying to make it work, I pulled the plug on that idea. Hence KCS is now licensed forever under the GPLv3 license.

I still have a lew of use cases that I need to implement. And I still have to update our virtual, on-prem LAMP server hosting KCS at work. So there's much to do. Getting this project on GitHub was the first step!

The domain kioskcheckoutsystem.com is still mine, so I plan to open the firewall to the website (already developed) as soon as I make the changes relational to the new licensing, how to get it, etc. and double-check the web server security.

All this said, feel free to download KCS and deploy it on your own LAMP or WAMP server! I will add the actual blank MySQL DB files in the repository soon.

Thanks!
